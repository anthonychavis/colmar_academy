Colmar Academy
=============

Objective, _described by Codecademy:_
------------------------------------------------------

**Colmar Academy**  
You are tasked with designing and creating the landing page for a new school. You will help them by making informed design decisions about color and typography using the skills you learned last week. You will then implement your design.

For this project we will provide you with _wireframes_. A wireframe is a document which contains the positioning of the elements on a page without specifying any other design information. This allows designers and developers to focus on the flow of a site without getting distracted with design decisions such as color and typography. These aspects of the design are important, but when they are introduced too early, they can detract from other important decisions.

For this project you will implement the site specified by the wireframes and make all remaining design decisions to complete the site. You can find the wireframes for this project [here](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/capstone-2/colmar-academy-spec.png).

My Approach
------------------

* First, this looks exciting to build. 
    * I am pretty sure I can build it with sections of flexbox throughout the entire page. 

After Thoughts (_so far_)
--------------------

* I actually tried a few different colors at first.
    * Initially, I tried to steal like an artist by checking websites of various universities.
    * Once I got some feedback from friends and family on the original colors, I had a solid idea of what would look nice and stand out some. 
    * Then, I pivoted to a color I like.
* I chose the color scheme here because:
    * Purple is a powerfully elegant color.
        * So, that could appropriately represent the prestige of an esteemed academic institution - COLMAR ACADEMY
    * I wanted to use something I have seen UX/UI designers suggest - hsl - by adjusting the hue and lightness of a color to create contrast
    * I thought it boring to simply go back and forth between only 2 backgrounds for the four sections of the page. So, I created one with a totally different background.
    * It was obvious that certain articles were to be highlighted. So, I took the opportunity to highlight them with a totally different background that stood out, provided contrast, broke the monotony, but still complemented the dominant color of the page. 
        * So, the blue was used in 3 of the four sections.
* Eventually, I would like to use grid. 
    * Thinking compatibility will be an issue. So, this is how I will challenge myself a little extra.
